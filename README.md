<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Project ByteBurguer is a project built in the second period of the undergraduate course in Computer Science at the State University of Paraíba (UEPB) - Campus I. The project consists of a menu and order control system for a restaurant (fictitiously named "ByteBurguer ").</p>

<h3><strong>Goals:</strong></h3>
<p>The main focus of the project is the study of the construction of some features in the C language, such as linked lists, structs, file manipulation, pointers, and the entire general study of the C language. It also had as its main objective the specific study of basic data structure using the C programming language.</p>

<h3><strong>Functionalities:</strong></h3>
<p>✔️ It is possible to add or remove a product from the restaurant menu.</p>
<p>✔️ It is possible to add or remove a command (order) with customer information.</p>
<p>✔️ It is possible to add a product from the menu to the customer's command.</p>
<p>✔️ The value of the order is added to the restaurant's cash register when it is defined as paid.</p>
<p>✔️ It is possible to add or subtract amounts from the restaurant's cash value.</p>
<p>✔️ Menu and command records are saved in .txt files located in "DataBase".</p>

<h3><strong>Observation:</strong></h3>
<p>⚠️ The program interface is in the terminal itself.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>• The program was built 100% in the C programming language.</p>
<p>• The program was built using the code editor (Visual Studio Code).</p>

<br>

<blockquote><strong>Obs:</strong> The program has some limitations in error handling, insertion and file reading, among other small details.</blockquote>
